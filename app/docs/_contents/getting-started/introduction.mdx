## Welcome to BeeCI!

Welcome to Bee-CI, a cutting-edge continuous integration (CI) system designed to streamline your development workflow. Bee-CI simplifies the process of building and testing code, integrating seamlessly with GitHub to provide a user-friendly and powerful experience.

At its core, Bee-CI automates the most critical aspects of CI. Builds are triggered automatically in response to code pushes, ensuring that your application remains in a consistent, high-quality state without manual intervention.

Bee-CI is built as a GitHub App, making it easy to integrate into your existing development pipeline. By leveraging GitHub's API, the system provides advanced functionality, such as detailed build statuses directly tied to individual commits. This deep integration allows you to track your project's progress and catch issues early.

Configuration is straightforward, thanks to a simple JSON-based approach. Users define their workflows in a clear, intuitive configuration file, ensuring that setting up Bee-CI is as efficient as the application itself.

Bee-CI is the perfect choice for teams looking to enhance their development process with a reliable, feature-rich CI solution tailored to modern workflows.
